			If we haven't met yet... Hi! I'm Abigail, nice to meet you! I just wanted to thank you again for taking the time to visit my site and learn more about me. <br>
			Even though I am on my third year of my Bachelor of Science in Victoria University, I still have one more trimester left to finish next year. <br>
			This is due to me initially pursuing a different major in my first year entering University, so at the moment I am seeking an internship or a part-time position.

		</p>

			That aside... let's move onto hopefully more exciting things!

			Recently, I had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some pretty amazing people at Summer of Tech's Wellington Create Camp. <br>
			In just two short days, the team and I presented our app which featured a recent event, Wellington On A Plate, which provides you <br>
			the best burger recommendation based on certain user inputs.

			This was my first experience putting the technical skills I learnt in University in practice outside of study. <br>
			It was amazing how we went from being a group of strangers initially, to a strong team that brought out the best in each other. <br>
			I definitely learnt a lot from this weekend and I am very excited to see where my career path will lead me to.

			Currently, for a group project in one of my courses, I am a part of a team that helps define system requirements and produce a high-fidelity prototype. <br>
			With this project, we used our knowledge and skill in Business and System Analysis, User Experience Design and App Development. <br>
			My team is made up of absolutely amazing individuals. I strongly believe in not only good work ethic but amazing team work, and this team shares the same beliefs. <br>

			I find this course very exciting as it gives us an opportunity to work along side real clients and get to apply our theoretical knowledge to a real problem. <br>
			Our prototype at the moment is still under works, but we are making amazing progress and will be finalizing it very soon!

			In a recent project for my Computer Game Development course, Computer Science students were required to pair up with a design student to create any game. <br>
			From talking to a number of design students it didn't take me long to find someone who I connected with. Not long after we decided to create a Tower Defense Game. <br>
			I found this project difficult to start initially as it was my first time using Unity, but I quickly got the hang of it and found that I quite enjoyed it. <br>

			Below is the little video we made of our game. It includes the documentation of our Game Development.
