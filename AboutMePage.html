			If we haven't met yet... Hi! I'm Abigail, nice to meet you! I just wanted to thank you again for taking the time to visit my site and learn more about me. <br>
			Even though I am on my third year of my Bachelor of Science in Victoria University, I still have one more trimester left to finish next year. <br>
			This is due to me initially pursuing a different major in my first year entering University, so at the moment I am seeking an internship or a part-time position.

			That aside... let's move onto hopefully more exciting things!

			Recently, I had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some pretty amazing people at Summer of Tech's Wellington Create Camp. <br>
			In just two short days, the team and I presented our app which featured a recent event, Wellington On A Plate, which provides you <br>
			the best burger recommendation based on certain user inputs.

			This was my first experience putting the technical skills I learnt in University in practice outside of study. <br>
			It was amazing how we went from being a group of strangers initially, to a strong team that brought out the best in each other. <br>
			I definitely learnt a lot from this weekend and I am very excited to see where my career path will lead me to.

			Currently, I am part of one of the best teams I have ever worked with, for a group project.
