			<em>If we haven't met yet...</em> Hi! I'm Abigail, <strong>nice to meet you!</strong> I just wanted to thank you again for taking the time to visit my site and learn more about me.
			Even though I am on my third year of my Bachelor of Science in Victoria University, I still have one more trimester left to finish next year.
			This is due to me initially pursuing a different major in my first year entering University, so at the moment I am seeking an internship or a part-time position.

		</p>

		<p class="para" style=" color: white">

			That aside... <strong>let's move onto hopefully more exciting things!</strong>

			Recently, I had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some pretty amazing people at <strong>Summer of Tech's Wellington Create Camp.</strong>
			In just two short days, the team and I presented our app which featured a recent event, Wellington On A Plate, that provides you the best burger recommendation based on certain user inputs.

		</p>

		<p class="para" style=" color: white">

			It was amazing how we went from being a group of strangers initially, to a strong team that brought out the best in each other.
			This was my first experience putting the technical skills I learnt in University in practice outside of study.
			I definitely learnt a lot from this weekend and I am very excited to see where my career path will lead me to.

			Currently, for a group project in one of my courses, I am a part of a team that helps <em>define system requirements and produce a high-fidelity prototype.</em>
			With this project, we used our knowledge and skill in <strong>Business and System Analysis, User Experience Design and App Development.</strong>
			My team is made up of absolutely amazing individuals. I strongly believe in, not only good work ethic, but amazing team work and this team shares that same beliefs.

			I find this course very exciting as it gives us an opportunity to work along side <strong>real clients</strong> and get to apply our theoretical knowledge to a real problem.
			Our prototype at the moment is still under works, but we are making amazing progress and will be finalizing it <em>very soon!</em> Once it is done, I hopefully will be able to share it on here!

			In a recent project for my Computer Game Development course, Computer Science students were required to pair up with a design student to create any game.
			From talking to a number of design students it didn't take me long to find someone who I connected with. Not long after we decided to create a <strong>Tower Defense Game.</strong>
			I found this project difficult to start initially as it was my first time using Unity, but I quickly got the hang of it and found that <em>I quite enjoyed it.</em>

			Below is the little video of the gameplay.

			During my second year, for a course we were given the ability to chose a partner to create a <strong>high-fidelity prototype</strong> of a real estate website.
			Although it was my first time using JustInMind to build our prototypes, it was quite simple to use.

			I found this course quite helpful as it made me taught me more about UX Designing and Prototyping. Not only that, but it got me familiar to working with a team member instead of just myself.

			Going to my <strong>first ever website</strong> I built using <em>HTML an CSS.</em> It wasn't as much of a challenge as I thought it would be but it was still a mission to do.
			I quite liked the design of my webpages since I wanted to present the information in a more unique way, <em>unfortunately the person marking our websites didn't share the same mindset.</em>
			Reflecting back, I probably should have dialed back on the aesthetics of the design.

			<strong>Still,</strong> I am proud to present my first website as I had tons of fun making it!

			<strong>Last but not least!</strong> Initially upon entering University, I was majoring in Computer Science and Computer Graphics. From this I was able to work with Maya, which I found to be quite amazing.
			Although quickly I found that rendering large files was something my old outdated laptop could not handle, hence the partly rendered photo below. This render took over a full day, resulting in my laptop breaking.
			<em>Oops.</em>

			After the first render, I got myself a new laptop that was much better suited for the job. For our last final render for the course, it was suppose to be something that represented us.
			I love baking and cooking - <em>oops let me rephrase that,</em> I love eating so naturally baking and cooking followed.
